Hello:
Embedded Systems Course at AMIT.
This is the C Final project:
1. Add student data.
2. Get used size in the Database.
3. Get the list of all student IDs.
4. Check if the student's ID exists.
5. Delete student data.
All of it was done using the Linked list data structure to make the user be in charge of the memory allocation.
